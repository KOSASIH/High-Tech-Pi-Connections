# Description

High-Tech-Pi-Connections is an advanced project that aims to develop a cutting-edge high-tech system integrated with the Pi Network. The project focuses on harnessing the collective intelligence and advanced technologies to create smarter groups of people and computers working together to solve complex problems and make better decisions.

The project's main areas of focus are artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. With a particular emphasis on improving corporate strategic planning, product design, predictive modeling, and ensuring a smooth transition for displaced workers during the automation process.

The project's technical stack includes Git as a version control system, Nginx as a web server, and fcgiwrap for running CGI applications. The project also utilizes Perl-cgi to interact with the Git repository and enable web access to the Git repository.

Here's an example of how to set up and configure the Git repository on a Raspberry Pi, including Nginx and fcgiwrap:

1. Install Nginx, fcgiwrap, and Perl-cgi on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Create a new Git repository and set up the Nginx configuration to use Gitweb as a CGI script.
3. Set up an fcgiwrap service to run the Gitweb CGI script.
4. Clone the Git repository from the Raspberry Pi to a local machine.
5. Make changes and commit them to the local Git repository.
6. Push the changes to the Raspberry Pi Git repository.
